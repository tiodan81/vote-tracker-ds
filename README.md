Vote Tracker

by Dan Schwartz

It's the fun new game: vote for your favorite US Supreme Court Justices!

Users vote by clicking on pictures of justices. The votes are tallied and
displayed in a graph produced by chart.js, and stored in localStorage.
The vote counts can be reset by clicking the 'reset' button.
